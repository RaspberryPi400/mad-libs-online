# Mad Libs Online
Mad Libs Online is Mad Libs, but online! You choose a story, and then give it your chosen words. Then, it will fill in the blanks in the story with your words. No peeking at the story before you do it!

To use it, you can run it in a IDE or online Python complier. Or, just use my GitHub Pages site! The link is on the repo.
